                        <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies, (CONECCT) is a flagship conference of the IEEE Bangalore Section, India. The CONECCT 2023 in its 9th edition and will be held from JULY 14-16, 2023. The conference will feature plenary talks, tutorials, and invited papers by distinguished researchers and technologists as well as contributed papers from academics and industry professionals. Peer-reviewed accepted papers will most likely be published in IEEE Xplore as well as Conference Proceedings. Cyber-Physical Systems are transforming the way people interact with engineered systems. Cyber-Physical Systems integrate sensing, computation, control, and networking into physical objects and infrastructure, connecting them to the internet and to each other. Robots, intelligent buildings, implantable medical devices, and autonomous cars are all bright examples of CPS.</p>

                            <h6>Talk - Edge AI, for next generation AI applications ?</h6>
                            <p>28.77 million terabytes of data are generated every day, according to the latest estimates. The AI tools like chatGPT are evolving at an exponential rate to be able to process this huge amount of data and create insightful results. The next-generation AI applications might need more than the cloud AI model. The applications might need real-time decision-making. Edge AI, on the other hand, brings AI processing closer to the source of data, enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, and increased privacy and security. This talk will explore the potential of Edge AI. This talk we will explore the next-generation AI applications and their requirements. We will try to understand the need of compute resources for these applications and look at the relevance of Edge AI.</p>

                            <h6>Talk - Artificial Pancreas for Type-1 Diabetic Patients of India</h6>
                            <p>If the blood sugar becomes too low, it may lead to severe condition called hypo-glycemia, where a patient can quickly fall into coma and can even die if not treated quickly. On the other hand, if it remains too high for a long time, it leads to hyper-glycemia, commonly known as diabetes, where a variety of complicacies can arise too. The gluco-regulatory mechanism in human body largely consists of two hormones secreted by the pancreas system, namely the glucagon, secreted by α cells, and insulin, secreted by β cells. Glucagon is responsible for raising the blood sugar level, whereas insulin is responsible for lowering the blood sugar. Type-1 diabetic patients have pancreatic failure and are incapable of secreting any insulin to the blood plasma. Hence, if untreated, they cannot live for long time. The current practice, which is largely followed in the world, is through daily multiple insulin injections. Unfortunately, however, besides being painful, it normally leads to gross inaccuracies, thereby not being able to harvest the full potential of insulin. Fortunately, commercially available insulin pumps are now available which can be programmed to deliver the desired amount of insulin in a very slow rate. However, because they operate continuously for a long time, inaccuracies in manual programming also leads to inaccuracies leading to glucose excursions beyond the desired limits. To address this issue, the current in the world is to develop closed-loop feedback system, called artificial pancreas, where a small amount of insulin is continuously infused to the patient’s body through the subcutaneous route by an insulin pump, depending on the situation of the patient as sensed by the subcutaneous CGM sensor. This talk will give an overview of the concept, followed by the specific activities being carried out at the Indian Institute of Science, in collaboration with MS Ramaiah Medical, in Bangalore, towards development of an effective artificial pancreas system for Type-1 diabetic patients of India. From a modest beginning in 2017, substantial progress has been made in both back-end and front-end developments, leading to successful lab testing followed by clinical trials under controlled environment. The current status of this research, as well as the future plan of action towards realizing this dream, will be outlined in this talk. This includes an IoT solution for a companion App to be used by parents, doctors and caregivers.</p>

                            <p>Anti-virus software (AVS) tools are used to detect Malware in a system. However, software-based AVS are vulnerable to attacks. A malicious entity can exploit these vulnerabilities to subvert the AVS. Recently, hardware components such as Hardware Performance Counters (HPC) have been used for Malware detection, in the form of Anti-virus Hardware (AVH). In this talk, we will discuss HPC-based AVHs for improving embedded security and privacy. Subsequently, we will discuss their pitfalls. Next, we will present PREEMPT, a zero overhead, high-accuracy and low-latency technique to detect Malware by re-purposing the embedded trace buffer (ETB), a debug hardware component available in most modern processors. Finally, we will present some hardware security challenges and potential solutions, in utilizing the hardware as a root of trust. We will conclude the talk with future research directions and challenges.</p> -->

                            <h6>Talk - Scheduling Approaches for Accelerating Real-Time Tasks in Software-Hardware Codesign Paradigm</h6>
                            <p>Reconfigurable systems are increasingly being employed in a large class of today’s heterogeneous real-time systems which often demand satisfaction of stringent timeliness constraints. However, executing a set of hard real-time applications on reconfigurable systems such that all timing constraints are satisfied while also allowing efficient resource utilization requires effective scheduling, mapping and admission control strategies. In case of hardware tasks the reconfigurable space can considered as partitioned into tiles, which can be mapped to the tasks based on logic requirement and execution deadline. The tradeoff between task throughput, resource and energy requirements can be suitably handled in the run time by considering suitable hardware variants of the tasks that can be mapped through full/partial reconfiguration.This lecture will brief on the preliminary concepts of task processing on FPGAs using soft and hard cores and the related architectural design. Scheduling strategies will also be introduced in regards to efficient mapping of tasks on reconfigurable cores both in full and partial reconfiguration domain.</p>

                            <h6>Talk - Combating Adversarial Attacks on Tabular Datasets</h6>
                            <p>When working with large tabular datasets, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are preferred due to their in-core data processing capabilities. However, ANN models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which has led to a surge in research on developing effective defence strategies against such attacks. Generative models have been found to be more robust to adversarial attacks compared to discriminative models. This has led to the question of whether generative models can be used to defend discriminative models against adversarial attacks. The aim of this talk is to explore the potential of generative models in protecting ANN models from adversarial attacks, and to introduce some recently proposed techniques, e.g. D2A3, gD2A3 that take advantage of the generative-discriminative equivalence of certain ANN models.</p>

                            <h6>Talk - A Cyber-physical System Approach Towards Robust Battery Management Systems for Transportation Electrification Applications</h6>
                            <p>Electric Vehicle (EV) fleets have dramatically expanded over the past several years. There has been significant increase in interest to electrify all modes of transportation. EVs are primarily powered by Energy Storage Systems such as Lithium-ion Battery packs. Total battery pack capacity translates to the available range in an EV. State of Charge (SOC) is the ratio of available battery capacity to total capacity and is expressed in percentages. It is crucial to develop reliable Battery Management Systems for effective voltage and health monitoring of these battery packs. As the transportation industry electrifies most of its fleets there is a massive amount of data generated from various onboard systems. This data-driven approach demands a robust  Cyber-physical System architecture to maximize available range in an EV.  This talk will focus on understanding batteries and commercial battery management systems for electrifying vehicles.</p>
